## **Alternative to SCIM**

### [AccessOwl](https://www.accessowl.com/){:target="_blank"}

**User provisioning, deprovisioning, and a central overview of all access via service accounts**

### How It Works

AccessOwl uses RPA-like automation or private APIs for user provisioning via service accounts, integrating with any SaaS by navigating the UI directly. It syncs user lists, assigns roles, and removes access for employees who leave, bypassing the need for SCIM and supporting apps on lower-tier plans.

**Pros**

- Universal app coverage **-** works even for apps with no official API or SCIM support
- Provides a single dashboard for viewing and controlling user permissions across your entire stack
- Eliminates much of the manual account creation/deletion effort

**Cons**

- Requires an extra seat for a service account
- Advanced role-based access may still need manual handling or direct integration (i.e. AWS, Github)

### **AI Operators** (e.g. [Claude Computer Use](https://claude.ai/){:target="_blank"}, [OpenAI Operator](https://operator.chatgpt.com/){:target="_blank"})

**AI-driven automation for identity and access management**

#### How It Works

AI Operators connect to identity providers and SaaS apps, leveraging machine learning to automate user account creation, role assignment, and offboarding. They eliminate repetitive tasks while reducing admin overhead in identity management.

**Pros**

- Can handle multiple, unpredictable app workflows if the AI is well-trained
- Quick automation setup - often minimal coding or configuration required

**Cons**

- Currently error-prone, especially with complex role assignments or multi-step admin workflows
- You must trust the AI to accurately manage critical security tasks (which can be risky if it misinterprets an app’s UI)
- Often best suited for simpler, more routine tasks until AI solutions mature

## **Alternative to SAML**

### [**Okta Secure Web Authentication (SWA)**](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps-about-swa.htm){:target="_blank"}

**Okta’s SWA is a “password vault” approach to single sign-on**

#### What It Does

Okta Secure Web Authentication (SWA) injects stored credentials into login screens, enabling one-click access from Okta without SAML support. It’s typically included in lower-tier Okta plans, offering central password management and SSO-like benefits without premium fees.

**Pros**

- Easy to set up - no complex metadata or certificate exchange required.
- Centralizes credentials under one identity provider, reducing some password sprawl.
- Works for a broad range of apps that don’t (or won’t) offer SAML.

**Cons**

- Passwords are still in play, so a compromise of Okta or the user’s device can expose stored credentials
- Lacks federated features like Just-in-Time provisioning or attribute-based role assignment
- When you disable an employee in Okta, the app account may still remain valid if they know (or can reset) the password. You must fully deactivate them inside the SaaS for true offboarding

### **Google OIDC**

**A widely supported, but limited approach to Single-Sign-On**

**What It Does**

Google OpenID Connect (OIDC) uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate Workspace users, generating an ID token that SaaS apps verify for access. This modern alternative to SAML often works even on lower subscription tiers, simplifying sign-on without extra licensing.

**Pros**

- Widespread support among modern SaaS - often works on lower subscription tiers
- Simplified single sign-on flow for end users, they often just click “Sign in with Google”
- Similar to SAML, some vendors support automatically creating accounts upon first login (akin to Just-in-Time provisioning).

**Cons**

- Limited admin controls - no built-in way to enforce OIDC-only login or map Google groups/OUs to roles in many apps
- Some legacy apps or enterprise SaaS only support SAML, not OIDC
- Enforcement is app-dependent - if the vendor doesn’t let you disable native logins, employees can bypass OIDC.
